For each kit the following needs to be done:
Motor Manufacturing:
1. Cut 2 lengths of red wire, 2 lengths of black wire 3.25" (stranded 22awg) (for motor -> motor controller)
2. Strip 1/4" on each ends of these 4 wires.
3. Solder wires onto motor (1 red 1 black each)
4. Feed wires through strain relief, hot glue underneath strain relief. Make sure plastic motor holder is in 
proper spot. Be generous with the hot glue.
5. Hot glue (or epoxy) the encoder wheel onto the motor. (Note that the encoder wheels should be on the same side
that the wires are on the motor, this way the encoder wheels sit INSIDE the robot)
6. Attach the wheel to the motor such that it is on the side without the wires.

Wire:
Prep 1 of each (Red and Black Solid Core) 6" in length, 0.25" stripped on each end

Sensor Prep (HC_SR04 and MPU6050):
1. Sand edges of PCBs to remove any extra material left on the pcb from the factory.
2. Place the HC_SR04 into it's housing.
3. Solder the header pins to the MPU6050, making sure the header pins long side sticks out on the same side as the
componenets on the board.

QC Testing for all sensors.
1. QC Testing Code in repo, two scripts, 1 for each sensor, connect the sensor to the arduino, restart arduino, look for changing numbers on serial monitor.
2. Make sure you change sketchbook location to the arduino_code directory of this repository. File -> Preferences -> Sketchbook location
3. HC_SR04: Connect as follows: Vcc, TRIG, ECHO, GND -> +5V, D10, D2, GND
4. MPU6050: Connect as follow: Vcc, GND, SCL, SDA -> +5V, GND, A5, A4
5. Optical Interrupt: OUT, VCC, GND -> D2, +5V, GND
5b. For optical interrupt pass something through the sensor and you should see the serial monitor number increase

Motor Controller Prep:
1. Drill out each of the mounting holes on the L298N breakout board with a 3.2 mm drill bit. This will ensure that
the fasteners won't be a pain for the students to place.

Bagging:
1. Bag all fasteners, spacers, ICSP pin spacer, mini screw driver, hex nut key into one bag.
2. Bag the sensors and sensor mounts in a bag. (MPU6050, HC_SR04, Optical Interrupt Sensor)
3. Bag the Ball caster, ball caster spacer, motor mounts in a small bag.'

Laser Cutting:
Frame - Acrylic
Encoder Wheel - Wood

3D Printing:
Clean support material from all parts.
